"Other shunt lesions can be considered such as PDA, AV canal or ASD. However, ASD should not result in left atrial enlargement."
"The differential diagnosis of cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascularity in an acyanotic patient includes atrial septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect (AV canal), ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and aortopulmonary window.

Synovial sarcoma: Synovial sarcoma occurs in young patients, and is a malignant soft tissue tumor commonly found periartciular in location. The name is a misnomer, as it is rarely intraarticular in location (23%).
On T2weighted imaging, the lesions are hyperintense and may have hemosiderin deposition, cystic change, and fluidfluid levels. On postcontrast imaging, there is prominent enhancement. There may be extension into adjacent bone. Synovial sarcomas may appear surprisingly benignappearing in children due to their small size and welldefined appearance."

The lesion in this child is solid, so none of the cystic lesions are reasonable considerations. If inflammatory changes were present, an infected branchial cleft cyst, lymphadenitis or abscess might be possible. Pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin's tumors and solid lymphoepithelial lesions are present within the parotid gland, and this lesion is next to the parotid gland.

Pilocytic astrocytoma can also present as an intra/suprasellar mass with cystic and solid enhancing components. However, there should be evidence of extension from the involved adjacent brain parenchyma.
Tuber cinereum hamartomas are typically small, nonenhancing tumors arising from the floor of the third ventricle, making it less likely in this case.
Rathke cleft cysts can be intra/suprasellar. 75% can have a nonenhancing intracystic nodule.

"Pseudoaneurysm: Possible given the surgical history in this area. However, there is no ""yingyang"" appearance of the vascularity on the ultrasound images. Gradual enhancement on the time resolved MRA is more suggestive of an enhancing lesion as opposed to a rapidly enhancing pseudoaneurysm.
Infection: No peripheral enhancement to suggest abscess, although clinical correlation is needed to exclude phlegmon.
Neoplasm: Cannot be differentiated based on these imaging characteristics. However, less likely given rapid growth of the lesion and surgical history."

"Choroid plexus papilloma/carcinoma: Most commonly presents in the atria of the lateral ventricle. Most common avidly enhancing mass in the lateral ventricle.
Ependymoma vs. medulloblastoma: If isolated to the fourth ventricle, both of which are more common than a fourth ventricular choroid plexus papilloma. Medulloblastomas are often hyperdense on noncontrast CT, and ependymomas are more heterogeneous in appearance, often with calcifications.
Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) of the choroid plexus: A nonLangerhan's cell histiocytosis affects the choroid plexus in 1.61.7% of patients with JXG. More common in older patients. Can be differentiated by LCH by immunohistochemical staining and absence of birbeck granules on electron microscopy.
Other intraventricular masses: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)  Tuberous sclerosis; typically near foramen of Monro. Central neurocytoma  arises from septum pellucidum, near foramen of Monro. Germinoma  arises in midline, often in or near third ventricle."

In AntleyBixler syndrome, the femora are bowed and the iliac bones have a vertical configuration in common with campomelic. Diastophic dysplasia and Larsen syndrome, hypoplastic cervical vertebrae, cervical kyphosis, joint dislocation, and abnormalities of tracheal cartilage are features in common with campomelic dysplasia. Anterior bowing of the tibia can occur in neurofibromatosis type I."
"In newborn the clavicular abnormality of cleidocranial dysplasia must not be mistaken for a fracture due to birth injury. Congenital pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle is mostly unilateral.

Other inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease or enteritis should also be considered, however this is not the typical presentation. An enteric duplication cyst should not appear solid unless it is filled with debris or demonstrates luminal communication with the bowel."
